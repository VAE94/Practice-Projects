            <h1>Rules for Autocomplete</h1>
            <p> <i>Posted on March 19, 2019 </i></p>
            <p>Autocompleting text with known value seems like an easy problem to solve, but so many UIs get it
                wrong.I
                see
                this
                frequently enough that, rather than complain about them individually, though I'd just write down the
                set
                of
                rules they often break.</p>
            <p>There may be cases where some of the rules aren't the best thing to do, but there should be a good
                reason
                for
                breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these rules don't apply if a field if a field must
                be
                filled
                with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following these rules should always
                result
                in a
                very
                least a sane experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other options must
                    always
                    go
                    below
                    the one matching what they typed.</li>
                <li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type "Fr" I want "Fresno" not "San
                    Francisco".
                </li>
                <li>After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with substring matches
                    would
                    almost
                    always be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in
                    the
                    middle.
                </li>
                <li>If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequence matching.This is
                    only
                    useful
                    in some cases.</li>
                <li>If there are no subsequence /substring matches, it can optionally fall back to approximate
                    matches.
                    This
                    is
                    rarely necessary to provide.</li>
                <li>Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>
                <li>When one option is the prefix of another, put the <i> shortest one first.</i></li>
                <li>The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two options that differ only
                    by
                    case.In
                    that case(pun intended), prefer the one that more closely matches the user's input.</li>
                <li>The action to make use of the selection(e.g. to search the term) must be a differnt key than the
                    action
                    to
                    accept the fisrt suggestion <i>unless</i> you have to do something first to start using
                    autocomplete
                    suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should never have to take extra steps to
                    <i>not</i>
                    use
                    autocomplete.
                </li>
            </ul>
